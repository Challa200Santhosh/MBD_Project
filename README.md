 Title of the project :   Adaptive Traffic Light System
#Introduction
The Adaptive Traffic Light System is designed to efficiently manage vehicular flow at intersections by dynamically adjusting signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions. Utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller, this project integrates both digital and analog inputs to monitor traffic density and control signal outputs accordingly. The system aims to reduce congestion and improve traffic throughput.

#Requirements
To build this system, the following components are required:

Digital Inputs: 3
Analog Inputs: 3
Digital Outputs: 9
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno

#Virtual Prototype
A virtual prototype of the Adaptive Traffic Light System has been developed using Tinkercad, an online simulation platform. This prototype allows for testing and visualization of the system's functionality before physical implementation.
